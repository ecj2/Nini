# Momo

Momo is a relatively simple 2D game-making library written in JavaScript. It abstracts common tasks&mdash;such as managing user input, drawing images, and playing sounds&mdash;behind an easy-to-use interface.

Momo works on modern Web browsers which support WebGL 2, such as desktop versions of Chrome and Firefox.
