# Poyo

Poyo is a simple 2D game-making library written in JavaScript. It abstracts common tasks—such as managing mouse and keyboard events, drawing text and images, and playing sounds—behind an easy-to-use interface.

Poyo works on modern Web browsers which support WebGL 2, such as desktop versions of Chrome and Firefox. Its creation was heavily inspired by [Allegro](https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5), and it was designed to facilitate rapid prototyping.
